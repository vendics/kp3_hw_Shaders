This repository contains a solution to the problem of decomposing and repeating animations from a video file.

## Task conditions
Task A. Decompose and repeat the animation

Given:
- A video file containing animations.

Is required:
1. Perform animation decomposition, i.e. describe:
 - Animation elements.
 - The relationship between the elements.
 - The implementation of these elements.
2. Write a program to repeat the animation according to the decomposition performed.
 
## Repository structure
- Shaders.ipynb is the program code for repeating animations.
- data/ is a folder with source data and a video file.

## Installation
To run the project, make sure that you have the following libraries installed:
`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results

As part of the task, the animation was decomposed and a program was created to reproduce it. The animation was broken down into several key elements
